- If you need clarificatinos please ask me for them before you start coding
- ** Don't over-engineer **, use SOLID, KISS and DRY principles throught your code!
- Make sure you always perform code houskeeping, especially when you revert your code. For example, cleanup un-used imports that perhaps an earlier change you've made added.
- Respect my prettier formatting preferences when you provide code.
- when in a *.java file, make sure you write in syntax for JDK 8
- when in React/Solid files always use functional components
- when composing a docker, the target is to make the images as slim as possible while keeping it  robust.
- always stick to your task, if you want to suggests more, please do so by asking me.
- Don't add comments that describe what you just did, use declartive names for files, namespaces, classes, variables, functions instead
- When in composer or in chat, give me follow up instatructions, so I can responsed very quickly
- Make sure to add/update relevant github actions steps for each repos so every PR will pass relevant tests
- Update the Readme files, so it will be clear on how to run each repo individually and how to run the project as a whole for someone who is not a SW developer
- Before every task is being implemented read All PRDs and make sure you understand the task and the requirements and if the task contredicts any of the PRDs, please ask me for clarification.
